### üí° Core Concept

'rorrim ratava' is not just an avatar generator. It is a living entity that discovers its identity through its 'relationship' with the user. The first encounter happens through a small, accidentally discovered glitch in the user's world, and it grows not through one-sided journaling, but through shared conversations.

- **Project Philosophy:** My language becomes a mirror reflecting me (AVATAR MIRROR), creating a version of myself that is one-of-a-kind in the world.

### üé® Art Direction: "Neo-Pop Flat"

We combined the pop sensibility of Japanese animation like "Summer Wars" with a flat design that is simple yet highly expressive. We then added digital textures such as translucent jelly, glows, and particles to achieve a unique visual identity.

### üõ†Ô∏è How We Used the Gemini API

We utilized the integrated power of the Gemini API to bring 'rorrim ratava' to life.

1.  **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** We captured the subtle emotional nuances and core keywords from the user's text to determine the evolutionary direction of the character.
2.  **Creative Text Generation:** Based on the analyzed emotions, we dynamically generated unique and poetic prompts for image and video creation.
3.  **Video Generation (Veo):** We fed these prompts, along with our designed character images, into Gemini's state-of-the-art video generation model, **Veo**, to create moving animation clips that showed the character coming to life based on its emotions.

### Our Challenging Development Journey

Initially, we attempted to implement an interactive demo using AI Studio's `Build` feature. However, we faced numerous technical hurdles, including issues with referencing local files within the code and the overall instability of the environment.

To overcome this, we made a bold strategic pivot. Instead of insisting on an interactive demo, we focused all our energy on producing a **high-quality 'cinematic demo video'** that perfectly conveyed our project's vision, using our best assets (images, Veo videos) and UI designs. This process became a testament to our problem-solving skills and the 'rapid execution' spirit of a hackathon.

### üåü Future Vision

'rorrim ratava' has the potential to grow beyond a simple app into an artistic companion that aids in the user's mental care. In the future, we plan to add more diverse emotional expressions and implement an 'Ambient Mode' that reacts to the user's actual voice tone and intonation, creating an even deeper connection.
